                to 26% smaller than PNG images. This means faster loading times for your website and better user
                experience.</li>

            <li><strong>Versatile Compatibility:</strong> WEBP supports both lossy and lossless compression, as well as
                transparency (alpha channel), making it a versatile choice for various image needs.</li>
        </ul>
